# SparkDemo

About:
Spark is an e-commerce makeup store where customers can get access to new and exclusive products. Customers are able to create an account, login and out of the application securely. Customers can browse through available products and add items to their cart. 

Technologies:
I used Spring Boot to develop my application. The Spring Boot framework is a tool for creating web applications. It provides many pre-built components and libraries, like Spring Web, Spring Security, Thymelaf, and Spring Data JPA. 
I used MySQL to store my application's data because it is a widely used and reliable database that can handle large amounts of data.
I used Thymeleaf to create the dynamic and responsive web pages for my application. This allowed me to include dynamic data from my application's database in my HTML templates.
I used Spring Security to protect my application by providing features such as user authentication, and password encryption.
I used Spring Data JPA, which provides a high-level interface for performing common database operations, such as querying, saving, and updating data.
